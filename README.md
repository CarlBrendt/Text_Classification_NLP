# Text_Classification_NLP
Text Classification using RNN and Transformers
# Description
The Class_Using_RNN and Class_Using_Transformers folders contain the .ipynb model training file,<br>
the final solution as a csv file and the trained model itself.

# How to run on Google Colab
Download the .ipynb file you need from Google Colab and then run it using the GPU.<br>
All necessary files will be downloaded automatically.
